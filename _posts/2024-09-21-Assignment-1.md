For this assignment, our goal was to predict the optimal location to minimize the walking distance for the arriving elevator in CDS. To solve this problem, as a class we collected data on the arrival frequencies for the set of elevators, then calculated the optimal location by computing the expected values for the x and y coordinate varaibles. Compared to the theoretical coordinate, the optimized resulted with on average a few milimeters less of a walking distance to the next elevator.
